Please send patches to bugzilla (http://bugzilla.icculus.org/), you can also 
submit merge requests via our gitorious installation at http://git.iodoom.org,

The focus for iod3 is to develop a stable base suitable for further development
and provide players with the same Doom 3 experience they've had for years. As
such iod3 does not have any significant graphical enhancements and none are
planned at this time. However, improved graphic and sound patches will be 
accepted as long as they are entirely optional, do not require new media, and
are off by default.
